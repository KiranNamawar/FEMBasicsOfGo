### 4. InputOutput

**Location:** `InputOutput/`

Basic I/O operations and functions covering:

-   Function definitions and parameters
-   Data collections (arrays, slices, maps)
-   Variable scope and visibility

**Run:**

```bash
cd InputOutput
go run main.go
```

### 5. Museum

**Location:** `museum/`

-   Museum exhibition management

**Run:**

```bash
cd museum
go run main.go
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3001` in your browser.

### 6. Routines

**Location:** `routines/`

Concurrency examples demonstrating:

-   Goroutines for parallel execution
-   Channels for communication between goroutines
-   Synchronization patterns

**Run:**

```bash
cd routines
go run main.go
```

### 7. Structs

**Location:** `stucts/`

Advanced type system features including:

-   Struct definitions and methods
-   Interfaces and polymorphism
-   Type embedding and composition
-   Factory patterns

**Run:**

```bash
cd stucts
go run main.go
```
